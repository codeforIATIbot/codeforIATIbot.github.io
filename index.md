[CodeforIATIbot](https://github.com/codeforIATIbot) helps keep some [codeforIATI](https://codeforiati.org/) projects up-to-date:

 * it sends occasional pull requests to keep [non-embedded codelists](https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded) up-to-date
 * it allows Travis to deploy the [codelists](https://github.com/codeforIATI/codelists) project to github pages
 * it looks after some [IATI Data Dump](https://github.com/codeforIATI/iati-data-dump) gists, updating them daily

It also sends pull requests to keep [DAC codelists](https://github.com/datasets/dac-and-crs-code-lists) up-to-date.
