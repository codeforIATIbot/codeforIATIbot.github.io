[Code for IATI bot](https://github.com/codeforIATIbot) helps keep the following codeforIATI projects up-to-date:

 * it sends occasional pull requests to keep non-embedded codelists up-to-date
 * it allows Travis to deploy the codelists project to github pages
 * it looks after some IATI Data Dump gists, updating them daily

It also sends pull requests to keep DAC codelists up-to-date.
